# go-smithsonian-openaccess

Go package for working with the Smithsonian Open Access release

## Important

This is work in progress. Proper documentation to follow.

## Tools

### emit

A command-line tool for parsing and emitting individual records from a directory containing compressed and line-delimited Smithsonian OpenAccess JSON files.

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -h
  -bucket-uri string
    	A valid GoCloud bucket file:// URI.
  -format-json
    	Format JSON output for each record.
  -json
    	Emit a JSON list.
  -null
    	Emit to /dev/null
  -query value
    	One or more {PATH}={REGEXP} parameters for filtering records.
  -query-mode string
    	Specify how query filtering should be evaluated. Valid modes are: ALL, ANY (default "ALL")
  -stats
    	Display timings and statistics.
  -stdout
    	Emit to STDOUT (default true)
  -validate-json
    	Ensure each record is valid JSON.
  -workers int
    	The maximum number of concurrent workers. This is used to prevent filehandle exhaustion. (default 10)
```

For example, processing every record in the OpenAccess dataset ensuring it is valid JSON and emitting it to `/dev/null`:

```
> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
  -stdout=false \
  -validate-json \  		
  -null \
  -stats \
  -workers 20 \
  metadata/objects

2020/06/26 10:19:17 Processed 11620642 records in 12m1.141284159s
```

Or processing everything in the [Air and Space](https://airandspace.si.edu/collections) collection as JSON, passing the result to the `jq` tool and searching for things with "space" in the title:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -validate-json \  		   
   metadata/objects/NASM/ \
   | jq '.[]["title"]' \
   | grep -i 'space' \
   | sort

"Medal, NASA Space Flight, Sally Ride"
"Medal, STS-7, Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Sally Ride"
"Mirror, Primary Backup, Hubble Space Telescope"
"Model, 1:5, Hubble Space Telescope"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Delta-Wing High Cross-Range Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Final Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Space Shuttle, North American Rockwell Final Design, 1:15"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Straight-Wing Low Cross-Range Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Wind Tunnel, Convair Space Shuttle, 0.006 scale"
"Orbiter, Space Shuttle, OV-103, Discovery"
"Space Food, Beef and Vegetables, Mercury, Friendship 7"
"Spacecraft, Mariner 10, Flight Spare"
"Spacecraft, New Horizons, Mock-up, model"
"Suit, SpaceShipOne, Mike Melvill"
```

Or doing the same, but for [things about kittens](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18382391/) in the [Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org) collection:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -validate-json \  		      
   -stats \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM/ \
   | jq '.[]["title"]' \
   | grep -i 'kitten' \
   | sort

2020/06/26 09:45:15 Processed 43695 records in 4.175884858s
"Cat and kitten"
"Tabby's Kittens"
```

Or something similar by not emitting a JSON list but formatting each record (as JSON) and filtering for the words "title" and "kitten":

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -format-json \
   -validate-json=false \
   -stats \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM \
   | grep '"title"' \
   | grep -i 'kitten' \
   | sort
   
2020/06/26 10:02:59 Processed 43695 records in 5.045081835s
  "title": "Cat and kitten"
  "title": "Tabby\u0027s Kittens"
```

#### Inline queries

You can also specify inline queries by passing a `-query` parameter which is a string in the format of:

```
{PATH}={REGULAR EXPRESSION}
```

Paths follow the dot notation syntax used by the [tidwall/gjson](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) package and regular expressions are any valid [Go language regular expression](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).

Successful path looks will be treated as a list of candidates and each candidate's string value will be tested against the regular expression's [MatchString](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.MatchString) method.

For example:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -query 'title=cats?\s+' \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM \
   | jq '.[]["title"]'
   
"View of Moat Mountain from Wildcat Brook, Jackson, New Hampshire, Looking Southwest"
"Near Falls of Wildcat Brook, Jackson, New Hampshire"
```

You can pass multiple `-query` parameters:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -query 'title=cats?\s+' \
   -query 'title=(?i)^view' \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM \
   | jq '.[]["title"]'
   
"View of Moat Mountain from Wildcat Brook, Jackson, New Hampshire, Looking Southwest"
```

The default query mode is to ensure that all queries match but you can also specify that only one or more queries need to match by passing the `-query-mode ANY` flag:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -query 'title=cats?\s+' \
   -query 'title=(?i)^view' \
   -query-mode ANY \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM \
   | jq '.[]["title"]'
   
"View of Santi Giovanni e Paolo a Celio, Rome"
"View of a Morning Room Interior"
"View of the Louvre from the River"
"View of the Acropolis, Athens"
"View of Santi Giovanni e Paolo a Celio, Rome"
"Views Representing the Most Considerable Transactions in the Siege of a Place, from Twelve of the Most REmarkable Sieges and Battles in Europe"
"View of Shiba Coast (Shibaura no fukei) From the Series One Hundred Famous views of Edo"
"View of Florence, Plate from \"Scelta di XXIV Vedute delle principali contrade, piazze, chiese, e palazzi della CittÃ  di Firenze\""
"View of Venice, Italy"
"View Across a River"
"View of the Canadian Falls and Goat Island"

...and so on
```

Did you know that there are 61 (out of 11 million) objects in the Smithsonian collection with the word "kitten" in their title?

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -query 'title=(?i)kitten' \
   -stats \
   -workers 50 \
   metadata/objects \
   | jq '.[]["title"]'

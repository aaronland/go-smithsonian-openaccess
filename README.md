# go-smithsonian-openaccess

Go package for working with the Smithsonian Open Access release

## Important

This is work in progress. Proper documentation to follow.

## Tools

### emit

A command-line tool for parsing and emitting individual records from a directory containing compressed and line-delimited Smithsonian OpenAccess JSON files.

```
> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -h
  -bucket-uri string
    	A valid GoCloud bucket file:/// URI.
  -format-json
    	Format JSON output for each record.
  -json
    	Emit a JSON list.
  -null
    	Emit to /dev/null
  -stats
    	Display timings and statistics.
  -stdout
    	Emit to STDOUT (default true)
  -validate-json
    	Ensure each record is valid JSON. (default true)
  -workers int
    	The maximum number of concurrent workers. This is used to prevent filehandle exhaustion. (default 10)
```

For example, processing every record in the OpenAccess dataset ensuring it is valid JSON and emitting it to `/dev/null`:

```
> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
  -stdout=false -null \
  -stats \
  -workers 20 \
  metadata/objects

2020/06/26 10:19:17 Processed 11620642 records in 12m1.141284159s
```

Or processing everything in the [Air and Space](https://airandspace.si.edu/collections) collection as JSON, passing the result to the `jq` tool and searching for things with "space" in the title:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   metadata/objects/NASM/ \
   | jq '.[]["title"]' \
   | grep -i 'space' \
   | sort

"Medal, NASA Space Flight, Sally Ride"
"Medal, STS-7, Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Sally Ride"
"Mirror, Primary Backup, Hubble Space Telescope"
"Model, 1:5, Hubble Space Telescope"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Delta-Wing High Cross-Range Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Final Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Space Shuttle, North American Rockwell Final Design, 1:15"
"Model, Space Shuttle, Straight-Wing Low Cross-Range Orbiter Concept"
"Model, Wind Tunnel, Convair Space Shuttle, 0.006 scale"
"Orbiter, Space Shuttle, OV-103, Discovery"
"Space Food, Beef and Vegetables, Mercury, Friendship 7"
"Spacecraft, Mariner 10, Flight Spare"
"Spacecraft, New Horizons, Mock-up, model"
"Suit, SpaceShipOne, Mike Melvill"
```

Or doing the same, but for [things about kittens](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18382391/) in the [Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org) collection:

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -json \
   -stats \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM/ \
   | jq '.[]["title"]' \
   | grep -i 'kitten' \
   | sort

2020/06/26 09:45:15 Processed 43695 records in 4.175884858s
"Cat and kitten"
"Tabby's Kittens"
```

Or something similar by not emitting a JSON list but formatting each record (as JSON) and filtering for the words "title" and "kitten":

```
$> go run -mod vendor cmd/emit/main.go -bucket-uri file:///usr/local/OpenAccess \
   -format-json \
   -validate-json=false \
   -stats \
   metadata/objects/CHNDM \
   | grep '"title"' \
   | grep -i 'kitten' \
   | sort
   
2020/06/26 10:02:59 Processed 43695 records in 5.045081835s
  "title": "Cat and kitten"
  "title": "Tabby\u0027s Kittens"
```

As of this writing the `emit` tools lacks any kind of inline querying or filtering but it's on the list of [things to do soon](https://github.com/aaronland/go-smithsonian-openaccess/issues/1).
